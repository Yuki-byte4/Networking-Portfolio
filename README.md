Hands-on networking labs using Cisco Packet Tracer


## About Me

I am a motivated student with a strong interest in networking and
cybersecurity, currently building a solid technical foundation through
hands-on projects and continuous learning.

I have worked on multiple practical networking labs using Cisco Packet
Tracer, focusing on network design, IP addressing, routing, wireless
networks, and basic security controls. Through these projects, I have
developed a clear understanding of how networks are built, how devices
communicate, and how security decisions affect attack surfaces.

I am particularly interested in ethical hacking and cybersecurity, and
I approach networking with a security-first mindset. I enjoy learning
how systems work, analyzing configurations, and understanding both
their strengths and weaknesses.

I am highly motivated, disciplined, and eager to grow my skills through
real-world practice, labs, and further security-focused training. I am
currently seeking opportunities to continue learning, gain experience,
and contribute as a junior-level networking or security-focused
candidate.
